FILTERS COLLECTION written by Lucia Marchetti, Mattia Vaccari (University of Padova) & Eduardo Gonzalez-Solares (IoA Cambridge)
*** Latest update : 01 June 2011 ***

The filters*.res file contains a complete collection of filter response curves, corrected for QE of the telescope when necessary. Refers to the filters*.log running index to find the filters you need in the filters*.res file.

*** only for hyperz users**
- in the directory /filters-files there are all the original filters files (as downloaded from the web, *.txt) and the transformed ones to the hyperz friendly format (*forhyperz.txt) and taking into account, where necessary (and available) the quantum efficiency for each instrument. The instruction used to re-format the filters are in /filters-files/work-filters.pro (IDL script) and /filters-files/work-filters.src (stilts script)

- to use filters*.res one needs to increase the limit of maximum filters ingested by hyperz; increase the parameter "mxft" in files /src/filter_ascii.f and /src/compos_new.f (the default is mxft=300)

Version history:
- 100330 : first version of *.res & *.log
- 100414 : Corrected 2MASS for QE, Added WFC, KPNO,CTIO,UKIDSS all corrected for QE 
- 100607 : Corrected SPIRE 250, 350, 500 (in the 100414 version SPIRE 350 and 500 were stored in the *.res file in the wrong order of lambdas) and added to *.res file.
- 100910 : - Corrected for QE WFC, KPNO,CTIO,UKIDSS and TMASS, the previus version used wrong conversion factor; 
  	   - Updated to the last version of IRAC,MIPS and IRS filters;
	   - Added to *.res and *.log files CFHTLS, AKARI ,SUBARU, WFI, VIMOS, UKIDSS Z, UKIDSS Y, filters (alla corrected for quantum efficiency), and PACS filters as from 'PACS(/SPIRE) Instrument Simulator as of Herschel Launch'. 
	   - PACS filters as from 'PACS DP Pipeline as of Dec 09' are also availabel in the directory ~/hyperz/ZPHOT1.3/filters/filters-files/ with the names : 
  	   pacs-spec-resp-70-mum.asc  pacs-spec-resp-70-mum-forhyperz.txt
  	   pacs-spec-resp-100-mum.asc pacs-spec-resp-100-mum-forhyperz.txt
  	   pacs-spec-resp-160-mum.asc pacs-spec-resp-160-mum-forhyperz.txt
  	   We decide to not include these last version in the .res and *.log files to mantain homogeneity with the SPIRE version of the filters; 
	   The difference between the two versions of the PACS filters are in any case not so significant.

	   - corrected filters subaru "0340 Subaru SuprimeCam NB711" and "0341 Subaru SuprimeCam NB816", they were written in the wrong order of lambdas.

NOTES : 
The .res file is updated when necessary so it doesn't follow any order of lambdas or surveys.
The best way to find the filter you are insterested in is to browse/search the .log file and
determine the ID of your filter(s) of interest.

NB : "*" in .log file indicates the origin of the filter shape is unknown and thus probably dates back
to the .log file shipped with the hyperz code by Micol Bolzonella and then modified by Giulia Rodighiero

    	      - we take filters for the period before 4 July 2006 since the majority of the observation with ACS/WFC has been done during that period.
	      - ACS/HRC shares the same filters wheel with HST/WFC, but has different CCD response. 
	      	This instrument is used to cover very small areas with high resolution and we do not iclude its filters response in our compilation.

VISTA VIRCAM z, Y, J, H, ks (private communication with David Bonfield). This filters have been modified by David Bonfield as follow:
        by resampling and multiplying together the following:
	- filter transmission
	- mirror reflectivities
	- detector qe
	- model atmospheric transmission (i think the model is a 1 airmass,1mm water column model from MODTRAN but i have lost the reference for my spectrum.  I extrapolated shortward in wavelength for the Z-band as this is a near-ir model).
